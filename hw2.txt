C++: a string is simply a sequence of characters
	1 character in a string can be changes by using an assignment statement to the appropriate array element.
	to manipuate a portion of a string by substr() function is used in C++
	length or size functions are used to determine the length of a string
	to compare the two string comparasion are used in C++
	to cencatenate 2 string, + operator is used
Java and C#: String classis used to manipulate the strings. This class is particularly designed tostore and perform a large variety of operations on the stored strings. With the help of this Class, manipulation of string bevomes very fast and simple

Type and and scope of the variable used in loop

Is it legal to change the loop variable or loop parameters within the loop and also does that change the loop control

The parameters of loop change only once, or change along with each iteration

by isolating side-effectful operations within clearly defined boundaries, using dedicated constructs for managing state, and promoting the use of pure functions wherever possible, thereby enabling reasoning about code sections with predictable behavior even when interacting with external systems.

Passed by value:

list[0] = 1 and list[1] = 3

Passed by reference:

list[0] = 2 and list[1] = 6

Passed by value-effect:

list[0] = 2 and list[1] = 6

From the code segment above, the points to be noted are

    An integer array list is declared

    list is declared to accept only two integer values

    list[0] = 1

    list[1] = 3

For pass by value;

None of the actual arguments are changed, so the variables retain the values they were initialized with.

So,

list[0] = 1 and list[1] = 3

Passed by reference

With pass by reference, the arguments are changed.

Given that

list[0] = 1

list[1] = 3

The value of list[0] and list[1] are incremented by their respective original value, as follows

list[0] = 1 + 1 = 2

list[1] = 3 + 3 = 6

So, the new values becomes

list[0] = 2

list[1] = 6

Passed by value-effect

The passed by, value-result has the same effect as reference.

creating a closure that encapsulates the necessary state variables within the coroutine function, allowing the state to persist between each time the coroutine is suspended and resumed based on events, effectively acting as a "local memory" for the coroutine's execution flow.
