C++: a string is simply a sequence of characters
	1 character in a string can be changes by using an assignment statement to the appropriate array element.
	to manipuate a portion of a string by substr() function is used in C++
	length or size functions are used to determine the length of a string
	to compare the two string comparasion are used in C++
	to cencatenate 2 string, + operator is used
Java and C#: String class is used to manipulate the strings. This class is particularly designed tostore and perform a large variety of operations on the stored strings. With the help of this Class, manipulation of string bevomes very fast and simple

Type and and scope of the variable used in loop
Is it legal to change the loop variable or loop parameters within the loop and also does that change the loop control
The parameters of loop change only once, or change along with each iteration

scenarios where side effects are inevitable: 
	 I/O operations
	 mutable state
	 network requests
methods to retain benifits of referential transparency:
	Side effects encapsulation
	immutable data structures
	Higher-order functions

Passed by value: list = {1, 3}
Passed by reference: list = {2, 6}
Passed by value-effect: list = {2, 6}

closures enables function to encapsulate state within, creating a private scope that persists across function calls.

7.
Closures allow us to capture variables from a function, preserving their state across coroutine suspensions. Which mean coroutine can resume execution later with the same state.
